### Summary

In this chapter, you learned the basics of command line theory, including how to use the shell in a terminal, run various shell commands, and navigate the shell using features like tab completion. You installed software directly in the terminal using a package manager, and you wrote your first simple shell script.

In the next chapters, you’ll put these techniques into practice. In Chapter 4, you’ll use the terminal to explore hundreds of gigabytes of data from the BlueLeaks dataset. In Chapter 5, you’ll make datasets searchable by using programs that require running commands in a terminal. In Chapter 6, you’ll use a command line tool to convert emails from a proprietary format to an open format, making it easier for you to read them. You’ll also need your terminal skills to begin writing Python code in Chapter 7 and beyond.
