## Chapter 3: The Command Line Interface

“Back in the days of the command-line interface, users were all Morlocks who had to convert their thoughts into alphanumeric symbols and type them in, a grindingly tedious process that stripped away all ambiguity, laid bare all hidden assumptions, and cruelly punished laziness and imprecision.” 

— Neal Stephenson, from In the Beginning...Was the Command Line, 1999
